  - Market segment analysis
  - Component compatibility matrix

- **Auto-Complete Workflows**: 
  - One-click assignment of common component sets
  - Template-based assignments for new models
  - Smart defaults based on historical data

- **Components to Build**:
  - `SmartSuggestionEngine.tsx` - Core recommendation logic
  - `ComponentSuggestionCard.tsx` - UI for displaying suggestions
  - `AutoCompleteDialog.tsx` - Bulk suggestion application
  - `SuggestionService.ts` - Backend recommendation service

### 2. Advanced Validation System üîç
**Priority: High**

- **Compatibility Checking**: 
  - Engine-to-frame compatibility
  - Brake system requirements validation
  - Weight distribution analysis
  - Performance envelope verification

- **Completeness Validation**:
  - Missing component detection
  - Required vs optional component tracking
  - Configuration completeness scoring
  - Data quality metrics

- **Components to Build**:
  - `ValidationEngine.tsx` - Core validation logic
  - `CompatibilityMatrix.tsx` - Component compatibility rules
  - `ValidationResultsPanel.tsx` - Results display
  - `DataQualityDashboard.tsx` - Quality metrics overview

### 3. Enhanced Bulk Operations üöÄ
**Priority: Medium**

- **Advanced Filtering**: 
  - Multi-dimensional filtering (year, brand, category, market)
  - Saved filter presets
  - Custom query builder
  - Export filtered results

- **Batch Processing**:
  - Progress tracking for large operations
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Operation scheduling
  - Conflict resolution workflows

- **Components to Build**:
  - `AdvancedFilterPanel.tsx` - Enhanced filtering UI
  - `BatchOperationQueue.tsx` - Operation management
  - `OperationHistoryPanel.tsx` - Audit trail
  - `ConflictResolutionDialog.tsx` - Handle assignment conflicts

### 4. Component Analytics & Insights üìä
**Priority: Medium**

- **Usage Analytics**:
  - Most/least used components
  - Brand-specific component preferences
  - Market trend analysis
  - Cost optimization insights

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Assignment completion rates
  - Data quality scores
  - User efficiency metrics
  - System performance monitoring

- **Components to Build**:
  - `ComponentAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Main analytics view
  - `UsageChartsPanel.tsx` - Visual data representation
  - `TrendAnalysisView.tsx` - Trend identification
  - `PerformanceMetrics.tsx` - System performance tracking
